# Tasks to be accomplished during this self-paced pre-course lab:
Please complete these tasks when you arrive on the island, during the time dedicated to prelab. 

1. ## Setting up your computer with software:
If you haven't installed the required software prior to arriving FHL, please do so during this prelab session. Required software is listed on the top level of the course repository. 

2. ## Copy the contents of the USB drive you will find in the dining hall to your desktop. 

This contains the large docker image we will use for the later labs. Once you copied the file on your desktop, please follow these instructions to set up the docker container on your computer. While may take sometime, you can proceed with other tasks meanwhile. 

3. ## [Review the git/github tutorial (45-60 minutes).](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/W_2020/blob/master/prelab/Git_Prelab.md)
We will be using git version control system through out the workshop. We may use it to update the lab tutorials, to give you updated source codes, or data that we customize during the workshop. We will assume you will be familiar with cloning and updating the source code repositories.

4. ## [Review Introduction to R for beginners](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) (120-180 minutes).
