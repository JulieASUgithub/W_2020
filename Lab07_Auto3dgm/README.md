# Lab Auto3Dgm: Establishing Landmark-free Correspondence 
In this lab, you will

* use `Auto3dgm` module to align the gorilla skull dataset
* visualize aligned data in Slicer or in a web browser
* use pseudolandmarks computed with the `Auto3dgm` module to visualize the mean shape and principal components in the `GPA` module
 
## 1. Auto3dgm UI in Slicer
The auto3dgm UI consists of three components:
* **setup**: load data and specifiy parameters used in the auto3dgm algorithm
* **run**: subsample and align the data
* **visualize**: the aligned data in a pop-up window

## 2. Path setups and parameters
In the **setup** tab, specify 
* input folder: location where you saved the downsampled gorilla skull dataset, e.g., 
```
/Users/shanshan/Dropbox/Gorilla_small_ds/gorilla_scull_ds
```
* output folder: location where you want to save the aligned data and the pseudolandmarks, e.g., 
```
/Users/shanshan/Documents/Slicer/result
```

Then click on **Load Data**.

As we discussed in the previous lecture, auto3dgm uses a two-phase analysis for shape alignment. The algorithm first subsamples two sets of pseudolandmarks for each shape, and then aligns the subsampled points. In the algorithm, we will need to specify how many points we will subsample in each phase.  Due to time constraint in this tutorial, let's only use **20 points for phase 1** and **40 points for phase 2**. In general, a few hundred points will give pretty good shape alignment. The more points we use, the better the results.

There are some other parameters in the auto3dgm UI. In general, you can leave them as they are. 
* **Maximum iterations**: the max number of alignment 
* **Allow reflection**: if selected, mirror reflection will be allowed to optimize alignment. 
* **Subsampling**: 
    * *Farthest point sampling* (FPS): select evenly-spreading points
    * *Gaussian process landmarks* (GPL): select feature-aware points
    * *FPS + GPL hybrid*: select feature-aware points and complemented with evenly-spreading points for optimal speed and accuracy
* **Optional FPS seed**: specify the first point to be selected in FPS. If not specified, the algorithm will use the first one.
* **Hybrid GPL points**: number of feature-aware points to be used in the analysis. The number should be smaller than phase 1 points. 
* **Processing**: options for parallel computing. This will be implemented in future release. 

## 3. Run auto3dgm
In the **run** tab, you can either run the entire analysis or run each step separately. Here I just click "run all steps". The aligned data and the registered pseudolandmarks (in .fcsv files) will be saved in the specified output folder. 

This will take about 5 minutes. 

## 4. Visualize aligned data
The **visualize** tab allows you to see how the aligned data look like. 

Click on **Start mesh visualization viewer**. 

You can select either **visualize phase 1 alignment** or **visualize phase 2 alignment**.
The aligned shapes will be shown in a pop-up browser window. 
:bangbang: Very Important :bangbang: make sure you click on **Stop mesh visualization viewer** button after you finish the visualization. 

If you are using the customized version of 3D Slicer for this workshop, and Slicer crashes :trollface:, please do the following instead.

Launch your browser and direct it to '' http://localhost:8000/index.html ''

## 5. SlicerMorph with auto3dgm pseudolandmarks
You can find the aligned pseudolandmarks (.fcsv files) in the output folder you specified Step 2. Go to folder *Phase 2* and then folder *aligned_landmarks*.

In the previous lab on SlicerMorph, you learned how to do statistical shape analysis with user-specified landmarks in the "GPA" module. In this part, we will compare the mean and PCA plot generated by SlicerMorph using four set of landmarks:

1) user-picked landmarks (in folder "W2020_Sample_Data >Gorilla_Skulls")
2) semi-landmarks (in folder "W2020_Sample_Data >Gorilla_Skulls>Semi-Landmarks")
3) low-resolution auto3dgm landmarks (computed during lab in folder "Output folder > Phase2 > aligned_landmarks" )
4) high-resolution auto3dgm landmarks (in folder "Lab07_Auto3dgm > HighResLmks").

Open `GPA` module and compute the mean shape and the principal component analysis for each set of landmarks. 

## 6. Work on your own data
Make sure your data are saved in the format of .ply
