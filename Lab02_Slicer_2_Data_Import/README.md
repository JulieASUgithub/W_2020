# Lab 02 Slicer#2: Data formats, importing data from MorphoSource, saving
* **image stacks vs volume files** We prefer to import the image sequences and save them as 3D volume to the convenience of working with single files. The primary reason for that, except for DICOM format, most 2D image format are not well-suited to preserve the geometry and resolution information of volumetric scans. That means, if you import and image sequence into Slicer/SlicerMorph, and not save it in a 3D volume format, next time you want to work on the same dataset you will have to redo the import steps. Therefore, we suggest the first step in your workflow immediate after importing your data is to save it in a volumetric format (see below).  

Additionally 3D Slicer would treat certain types of image sequences (namely JPG, PNG and BMO formats) as multichannel images, not scalar volumes. This creates additional complication and triples the memory requirement importing these data formats. Therefore, we developed a SlicerMorph specific module called **ImageStacks** to import these generic non-DICOM sequences. There is another SlicerMorph specific module called **SkyscanReconImport** which works solely for image sequences generated by the Bruker/SkyScan microCTs. 

In this lab we will review how to import non-DICOM stacks using both modules. (NOTE: If you are curious how these import functions compare to generic method offered by 3D Slicer you can review the previous iteration of this lab that used the generic functionality here https://github.com/SlicerMorph/S_2019/blob/master/Lab03_Slicer_2_data_formats_input_output/README.md#image-import-examples). 

## Two well-documented, and commonly supported image volume formats are:
* [Nearly Raw Raster Data: NRRD](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html) Slicer's default volume format. 
* [Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative: Nifti](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/)

* [List of image formats supported by Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/SupportedDataFormat)
* [pixel coordinates vs physical coordinates](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Coordinate_systems)
